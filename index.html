    <h1>Welcome to My Outdoor Adventures</h1>
    <p>Hello! I'm William Felipe Quiroz, and I have always felt a deep connection to the outdoors. Growing up in Orlando, Florida, I spent countless hours fishing, exploring the woods, and discovering the beauty of nature. These experiences sparked my passion for the outdoors which grew while I was in college. While at Northeastern,I have been able to do multiple hiking and camping trips which were completely differnt from Floridas' wildlife. </p>
