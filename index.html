    <h1>Welcome to My Outdoor Adventures</h1>
    <p>Hello! I'm William Felipe Quiroz, and I have always felt a deep connection to the outdoors. Growing up in Orlando, Florida, I spent a ton of time fishing, 
        exploring the woods, and discovering the beauty of Florida's nature. These experiences sparked my passion for the outdoors which grew while I was in college. 
        While at Northeastern,I have been able to do multiple hiking and camping trips which were completely different from Floridas' wildlife. I love escaping the city.
        I haven't had multiple hikes from all kinds of difficulties. I even did a half marathon Spartan race in Killington, VT! Northeastern also gave me the opportunity 
        to go to visit Australia on my Dialogue of Civilizations. In Australia I was able to explore a ton of nature including the great barrier reef, blue mountains,
        and the 12 disciples. I have multiple other trips planned for you all to keep an eye out for! This includes a winter trip to Banff, a fall camping trip in Vermont, 
        a Safari trip in South Africa, and fly fishing in the Galapagos. To sum it up, I have a very deep connection with nature, as seen from my previous experiences,
        and I want to grow this connection even deeper.</p>
