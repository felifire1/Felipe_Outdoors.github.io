    <h2>My Favorite Outdoor Activities</h2>
    <p>In this photo, my friend and I were fishing out of Miami, FL. My friend and I tag teamed a fourty-five pound Mahi Mahi. 
      My friend is holding the Mahi Mahi in the photo, this took about forty-five minutes to an hour to reel in. The strategy we were using for this catch was called trolling. 
      Trolling consists of dropping the bait down to a specific depth, then driving the boat at a specific speed to make the fake bait imitate real bait. 
      I am holding a smaller Mahi Mahi that I caught and a small Bluefin Tuna that I caught. The strategy I used to catch the Mahi Mahi was the same, 
      but I used a strategy called jigging for the bluefin tuna. Jigging consists of having a heavy lure, dropping it either very low or having them drop to the bottom,
      then pulling up on the rod and slowly reeling in, imitating squid. These fish are the biggest fish that I have ever caught except for a five foot barracuda 
      that I caught in the Bahamas and a five and a half foot bull shark that I caught off the surf in Orlando, FL.
      This was one of my first deep water fishing charters and honestly one of the best memories that I have lived as I shared it with my best friend named CJ.
      Since then, I have booked multiple other deep sea charters because I love them.</p>
